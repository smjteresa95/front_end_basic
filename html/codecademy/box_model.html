            <p>Until recently, construction on the banks of the Lake had been largely under the control of real estate developers. 
                Construction activities have resulted in a clouding of the lake's blue waters.</p>
            
            <p>Currently, the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is regulating construction along the shoreline and has won two Federal Supreme Court battles over recent decisions. 
                These regulations are unpopular with many residents, especially those in the Tahoe Lakefront Homeowners Association.</p>
